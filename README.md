# Dynamic Weather Dashboard  

Welcome to the Dynamic Weather Dashboard – your pocket-friendly weather companion 🌍.  
This project brings real-time weather updates and a 5-day forecast for cities across the globe,with modern interface.  

Think of it as a lightweight alternative to big weather apps — clean, simple, and built to show you only what you need!  

Instead of opening heavy apps, I wanted something minimal, fast, and fun that anyone can use in their browser.
